# Redux Saga Demo
A small demo of redux saga functionality with some tests.

Ignore the rest of the repo, was attempting to build a slide deck route that parsed a YAML file but gave up at 1am and probably won't be bothering to clean that bit up.

Also I wrote this in TypeScript, because I think TypeScript is neat. Enjoy.
